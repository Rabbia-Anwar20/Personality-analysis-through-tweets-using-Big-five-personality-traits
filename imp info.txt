do separate sentiment for emojis than combine it with text,

do citation of every libraries,


weeknesses of our system,
our scrapping method doesn't scrap images and their sentiment,it only works on text and emojis,

--it is basically clusterig problem,not

--check mam data or mukaram's in case you go for supervised...

--pehlay questionare say traits nikalay jatay thay,recent study say pta chla hm us text say b traits 
nikal sktay hain jo particular user nay likha ho based(based frequency of words he/she wrotes),hm nay
sentiment b nikaalnay hain,

--ANN,SVM walay me page 2 pr marked,

--ANN,SVM walay me only tf-idf pr kam ho rha hai no sentiment,but unho nay verification questionair he
he use kia hai

--five factors Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion ,Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN)

--how to validate if I go for supervised,

--wrote about app,web or android,insipirational/motivational video/book suggestion,emotions from mam
sania csv,

--Automated Personality Classification (APC)

--traits labels classifier is binary,if lie than 1 else 0

--deep learning based personality detection used CNN five different networks, all with the same 
architecture

--15 questions for validations,,,

--vader library also doing automatically sentiment of emojis...

--add vader work in FYP paper,

--collect 50 tweets,for each first +ve and -ve,than aply word frequenecy to check in which
trait it lies,for whole +ve and -ve take avg summ all out from vader and divide by 50(total tweets) 
 and for traits take avg for each trait,every trait output trait in the form of 5 length array
 with values of 1 and 0,1 for which trait words occur and 0 for not,(what if words occur from 
more than one trait,think it)

--just calc the sentiment and NN will learn it a/c to outputs,
--I stuck at,(what if words occur from  more than one trait,think it)

--I got it,check PSP-PID file im mam sania folder,first check every tweet on the basis of frequency
 of words and assign value from csv than take avg of all tweets,if no found any word a/c to any
 particular trait assign value one,
-another method get sentiment using textblob,

--finally,first get frequencey(bag of words)(like avg of all words a/c to trait) than multiply it with 
 poolarity(text blob.polarity),  predict personality with higher value,
bag of words=appearance of words counting
--text blob use ML technique for classifying polarity,

--use compound from vader and multiply it with avg of bag of words,(do for single tweet than get the avg)
--remove stop words,do stemming(check if there is need of stemming or not,dont do it),
--now think about model you should use,
--and final app,recommend books,talks,try to recommend qurani ayats and ahadith as well imam's quotes,
--skip image processing,
---if compound is 0 multiply avg with 1,
--what if text contain many words from a trait but has -ve sentiment value?think about it..
--no need of removing RT(retweet) mentions and links,vader does that automatically,
--but it is good to remove them so bag of words doesn't include garbage value(garbage value means
 counting of RT,mentions of links),
--why words are repeating in same trait or in different :'(
--there is an idea what if I collect all adjectives related to all traits
--ask from sir,bag of firds give good results,but we are unable to find doing it on the basis sentiment,
 of sentiment,
--session with sir tafseer,like chlo hm nay us data pr model train kr lia jo hmaray pass essays k nam say hai,
 but jb realtime pr tweet uthaay gain to us me say traits ksay nikaalain bag of words say,ya sentiment 
 if sentiment then wohi issue k sirf polarity trait ksay btay ge...

--for IPIP --Concerning the relationships between Intellect/Imagination and Openness to Experience and between 
Emotional Stability and Neuroticism, they are highly similar constructs. Intellect/Imagination and Emotional 
Stability were identified from factor analyses of ratings on individual personality trait adjectives, while 
Openness and Neuroticism were identified from analyses of questionnaires.

--start from find words according to question and its negativity or positivity,from paper and data from mam sania
